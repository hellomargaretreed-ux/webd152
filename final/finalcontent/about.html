<h2>About Us</h2>

<section>
<h3>Meet Will and Chayanne</h3>
<p>When you stay at Pacific Trails Resort, you will be cared for by the owners, Will and Cheyenne Smith, along with a team of friendly, down-to-earth service professionals. Will has spent his entire life here on the Central Coast, so he knows all the hidden treasures to be found in the region. Chayanne, on the other hand, has traveled all over the world - but she has yet to find anywhere more beautiful or welcoming than Zephyr, California. Together, they have created this charming resort that has something for everyone. </p>
