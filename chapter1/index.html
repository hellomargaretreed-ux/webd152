 <p>My favorite beverage is water with a splash of lemon juice. I find this drink to be simple and refreshing, and I could drink endless amounts of it. There are other beverages that I enjoy from time to time. For instance, just the other day I tried a chili mango kombucha drink that was delightful. But it's not something I could drink every day. Water with a splash of lemon on the other hand I could drink any time for any reason.</p>
